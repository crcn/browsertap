=head1 NAME

ffprobe - ffprobe media prober

=head1 SYNOPSIS

ffprobe [options] [F<input_file>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION


ffprobe gathers information from multimedia streams and prints it in
human- and machine-readable fashion.

For example it can be used to check the format of the container used
by a multimedia stream and the format and type of each media stream
contained in it.

If a filename is specified in input, ffprobe will try to open and
probe the file content. If the file cannot be opened or recognized as
a multimedia file, a positive exit code is returned.

ffprobe may be employed both as a standalone application or in
combination with a textual filter, which may perform more
sophisticated processing, e.g. statistical processing or plotting.

Options are used to list some of the formats supported by ffprobe or
for specifying which information to display, and for setting how
ffprobe will show it.

ffprobe output is designed to be easily parsable by a textual filter,
and consists of one or more sections of a form defined by the selected
writer, which is specified by the B<print_format> option.

Metadata tags stored in the container or in the streams are recognized
and printed in the corresponding "FORMAT" or "STREAM" section.


=head1 OPTIONS


All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept in input
a string representing a number, which may contain one of the
International System number postfixes, for example 'K', 'M', 'G'.
If 'i' is appended after the postfix, powers of 2 are used instead of
powers of 10. The 'B' postfix multiplies the value for 8, and can be
appended after another postfix or used alone. This allows using for
example 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as postfix.

Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing
with "no" the option name, for example using "-nofoo" in the
command line will set to false the boolean option with name "foo".



=head2 Stream specifiers

Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream specifiers
are used to precisely specify which stream(s) does a given option belong to.

A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name and
separated from it by a colon. E.g. C<-codec:a:1 ac3> option contains
C<a:1> stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream. Therefore it
would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

A stream specifier can match several streams, the option is then applied to all
of them. E.g. the stream specifier in C<-b:a 128k> matches all audio
streams.

An empty stream specifier matches all streams, for example C<-codec copy>
or C<-codec: copy> would copy all the streams without reencoding.

Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

=over 4


=item I<stream_index>

Matches the stream with this index. E.g. C<-threads:1 4> would set the
thread count for the second stream to 4.

=item I<stream_type>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

I<stream_type> is one of: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for subtitle,
'd' for data and 't' for attachments. If I<stream_index> is given, then
matches stream number I<stream_index> of this type. Otherwise matches all
streams of this type.

=item B<p:>I<program_id>B<[:>I<stream_index>B<]>

If I<stream_index> is given, then matches stream number I<stream_index> in
program with id I<program_id>. Otherwise matches all streams in this program.

=item B<#>I<stream_id>

Matches the stream by format-specific ID.

By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by the
terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log coloring
can be disabled setting the environment variable
B<AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR> or B<NO_COLOR>, or can be forced setting
the environment variable B<AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR>.
The use of the environment variable B<NO_COLOR> is deprecated and
will be dropped in a following FFmpeg version.


=item B<-report>

Dump full command line and console output to a file named
C<I<program>-I<YYYYMMDD>-I<HHMMSS>.log> in the current
directory.
This file can be useful for bug reports.
It also implies C<-loglevel verbose>.

Note: setting the environment variable C<FFREPORT> to any value has the
same effect.


=item B<-cpuflags flags (>I<global>B<)>

Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended
for testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.
	
	ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
	ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
	ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

=head2 AVOptions


These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
B<-help> option. They are separated into two categories:

=over 4


=item B<generic>

These options can be set for any container, codec or device. Generic options
are listed under AVFormatContext options for containers/devices and under
AVCodecContext options for codecs.

=item B<private>

These options are specific to the given container, device or codec. Private
options are listed under their corresponding containers/devices/codecs.

=back


For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
an MP3 file, use the B<id3v2_version> private option of the MP3
muxer:
	
	ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3


All codec AVOptions are obviously per-stream, so the chapter on stream
specifiers applies to them

Note B<-nooption> syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions,
use B<-option 0>/B<-option 1>.

Note2 old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by prepending
v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be removed soon.

To show only video packets belonging to the video stream with index 1:
	
	ffprobe -show_packets -select_streams v:1 INPUT



=item B<-show_data>

Show payload data, as an hexadecimal and ASCII dump. Coupled with
B<-show_packets>, it will dump the packets' data. Coupled with
B<-show_streams>, it will dump the codec extradata.

container format information, rather than all. This option may be given more
than once, then all specified entries will be shown.


=item B<-show_packets>

Show information about each packet contained in the input multimedia
stream.

The information for each single packet is printed within a dedicated
section with name "PACKET".


=item B<-show_frames>

Show information about each frame contained in the input multimedia
stream.

The information for each single frame is printed within a dedicated
section with name "FRAME".


=item B<-show_streams>

Show information about each media stream contained in the input
multimedia stream.

Each media stream information is printed within a dedicated section
with name "STREAM".


=item B<-count_frames>

Count the number of frames per stream and report it in the
corresponding stream section.


=item B<-count_packets>

Count the number of packets per stream and report it in the
corresponding stream section.


=item B<-show_private_data, -private>

Show private data, that is data depending on the format of the
particular shown element.
This option is enabled by default, but you may need to disable it
for specific uses, for example when creating XSD-compliant XML output.


=item B<-show_program_version>

Show information related to program version.

Version information is printed within a section with name
"PROGRAM_VERSION".


=item B<-show_library_versions>

Show information related to library versions.

Version information for each library is printed within a section with
name "LIBRARY_VERSION".


=item B<-show_versions>

Show information related to program and library versions. This is the
equivalent of setting both B<-show_program_version> and
B<-show_library_versions> options.

=head1 WRITERS


A writer defines the output format adopted by B<ffprobe>, and will be
used for printing all the parts of the output.

A writer may accept one or more arguments, which specify the options to
adopt.

A description of the currently available writers follows.


=head2 default

Default format.

Print each section in the form:
	
	[SECTION]
	key1=val1
	...
	keyN=valN
	[/SECTION]


Metadata tags are printed as a line in the corresponding FORMAT or
STREAM section, and are prefixed by the string "TAG:".

This writer accepts options as a list of I<key>=I<value> pairs,
separated by ":".

A description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4



=item B<nokey, nk>

If set to 1 specify not to print the key of each field. Default value
is 0.


=item B<noprint_wrappers, nw>

If set to 1 specify not to print the section header and footer.
Default value is 0.

=back



=head2 compact, csv

Compact and CSV format.

The C<csv> writer is equivalent to C<compact>, but supports
different defaults.

Each section is printed on a single line.
If no option is specifid, the output has the form:
	
	section|key1=val1| ... |keyN=valN


Metadata tags are printed in the corresponding "format" or "stream"
section. A metadata tag key, if printed, is prefixed by the string
"tag:".

This writer accepts options as a list of I<key>=I<value> pairs,
separated by ":".

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4



=item B<item_sep, s>

Specify the character to use for separating fields in the output line.
It must be a single printable character, it is "|" by default ("," for
the C<csv> writer).


=item B<nokey, nk>

If set to 1 specify not to print the key of each field. Its default
value is 0 (1 for the C<csv> writer).


=item B<escape, e>

Set the escape mode to use, default to "c" ("csv" for the C<csv>
writer).

It can assume one of the following values:

=over 4


=item B<c>

Perform C-like escaping. Strings containing a newline ('\n'), carriage
return ('\r'), a tab ('\t'), a form feed ('\f'), the escaping
character ('\') or the item separator character I<SEP> are escaped using C-like fashioned
escaping, so that a newline is converted to the sequence "\n", a
carriage return to "\r", '\' to "\\" and the separator I<SEP> is
converted to "\I<SEP>".


=item B<csv>

Perform CSV-like escaping, as described in RFC4180.  Strings
containing a newline ('\n'), a carriage return ('\r'), a double quote
('"'), or I<SEP> are enclosed in double-quotes.


=item B<none>

Perform no escaping.

=back



=item B<print_section, p>

Print the section name at the begin of each line if the value is
C<1>, disable it with value set to C<0>. Default value is
C<1>.


=back



=head2 flat

Flat format.

A free-form output where each line contains an explicit key=value, such as
"streams.stream.3.tags.foo=bar". The output is shell escaped, so it can be
directly embedded in sh scripts as long as the separator character is an
alphanumeric character or an underscore (see I<sep_char> option).

This writer accepts options as a list of I<key>=I<value> pairs,
separated by ":".

The description of the accepted options follows.


=over 4

=head1 SYNTAX


When evaluating specific formats, FFmpeg uses internal library parsing
functions, shared by the tools. This section documents the syntax of
some of these formats.



=head2 Date


The accepted syntax is:
	
	[(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
	now


If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
interpreted as UTC.
If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the current
year-month-day.



=head2 Time duration


The accepted syntax is:
	
	[-]HH:MM:SS[.m...]
	[-]S+[.m...]


I<HH> expresses the number of hours, I<MM> the number a of minutes
and I<SS> the number of seconds.



=head2 Video size

=head2 Video rate


Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
I<frame_rate_num>/I<frame_rate_den>, an integer number, a float
number or a valid video frame rate abbreviation.

The following abbreviations are recognized:

=over 4


=item B<ntsc>

=back




=head2 Ratio


A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
I<numerator>:I<denominator>.

Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is
considered valid, so you should check on the returned value if you
want to exclude those values.

The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.



=head2 Color


It can be the name of a color (case insensitive match) or a
[0x|#]RRGGBB[AA] sequence, possibly followed by "@" and a string
representing the alpha component.

The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
represents the opacity value (0x00/0.0 means completely transparent,
0xff/1.0 completely opaque).
If the alpha component is not specified then 0xff is assumed.

The string "random" will result in a random color.


=head1 DECODERS


Decoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the decoding of
multimedia streams.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native decoders
are enabled by default. Decoders requiring an external library must be enabled
manually via the corresponding C<--enable-lib> option. You can list all
available decoders using the configure option C<--list-decoders>.

You can disable all the decoders with the configure option
C<--disable-decoders> and selectively enable / disable single decoders
with the options C<--enable-decoder=I<DECODER>> /
C<--disable-decoder=I<DECODER>>.

The option C<-codecs> of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled decoders.


=head1 VIDEO DECODERS


A description of some of the currently available video decoders
follows.


=head2 rawvideo


Raw video decoder.

This decoder decodes rawvideo streams.


=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<top> I<top_field_first>

Specify the assumed field type of the input video.

=over 4


=item B<-1>

the video is assumed to be progressive (default)

=item B<0>

bottom-field-first is assumed

=item B<1>

top-field-first is assumed

=back



=back



=head1 AUDIO DECODERS



=head2 ffwavesynth


Internal wave synthetizer.

This decoder generates wave patterns according to predefined sequences. Its
use is purely internal and the format of the data it accepts is not publicly
documented.


=head1 DEMUXERS


Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to read the
multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-demuxers".

You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
"--disable-demuxers", and selectively enable a single demuxer with
the option "--enable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>", or disable it
with the option "--disable-demuxer=I<DEMUXER>".

The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of
enabled demuxers.

The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.


=head2 image2


Image file demuxer.

This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the
option I<pattern_type>.

The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
determine the format of the images contained in the files.

The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
same for all the files in the sequence.

This demuxer accepts the following options:

=over 4


=item B<framerate>

Set the framerate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

=item B<loop>

If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

=item B<pattern_type>

Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

I<pattern_type> accepts one of the following values.

=over 4


=item B<sequence>

Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of files
indexed by sequential numbers.

A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0I<N>d", which
specifies the position of the characters representing a sequential
number in each filename matched by the pattern. If the form
"%d0I<N>d" is used, the string representing the number in each
filename is 0-padded and I<N> is the total number of 0-padded
digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can be
specified in the pattern with the string "%%".

If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0I<N>d", the first filename of
the file list specified by the pattern must contain a number
inclusively contained between I<start_number> and
I<start_number>+I<start_number_range>-1, and all the following
numbers must be sequential.

For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
filenames of the form F<img-001.bmp>, F<img-002.bmp>, ...,
F<img-010.bmp>, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a
sequence of filenames of the form F<i%m%g-1.jpg>,
F<i%m%g-2.jpg>, ..., F<i%m%g-10.jpg>, etc.

Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
"%0I<N>d", for example to convert a single image file
F<img.jpeg> you can employ the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png



=item B<glob>

Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

The pattern is interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern. This is only
selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing support.


=item B<glob_sequence> I<(deprecated, will be removed)>

Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing support, and
the provided pattern contains at least one glob meta character among
C<%*?[]{}> that is preceded by an unescaped "%", the pattern is
interpreted like a C<glob()> pattern, otherwise it is interpreted
like a sequence pattern.

All glob special characters C<%*?[]{}> must be prefixed
with "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".

For example the pattern C<foo-%*.jpeg> will match all the
filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
C<foo-%?%?%?.jpeg> will match all the filenames prefixed with
"foo-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and terminating
with ".jpeg".

This pattern type is deprecated in favor of I<glob> and
I<sequence>.

=back


Default value is I<glob_sequence>.

=item B<pixel_format>

Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the pixel
format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=item B<start_number>

Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to start
to read from. Default value is 0.

=item B<start_number_range>

Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first image
file in the sequence, starting from I<start_number>. Default value
is 5.

=item B<video_size>

Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the video
size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

=back



=head3 Examples



=over 4


=item *

Use B<ffmpeg> for creating a video from the images in the file
sequence F<img-001.jpeg>, F<img-002.jpeg>, ..., assuming an
input frame rate of 10 frames per second:
	
	ffmpeg -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' -r 10 out.mkv



=item *

As above, but start by reading from a file with index 100 in the sequence:
	
	ffmpeg -start_number 100 -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' -r 10 out.mkv



=item *

Read images matching the "*.png" glob pattern , that is all the files
terminating with the ".png" suffix:
	
	ffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i "*.png" -r 10 out.mkv


=back



=head2 applehttp


Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.
The id field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting
the discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay),
the caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.
The total bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is
available in a metadata key named "variant_bitrate".


=head2 sbg


SBaGen script demuxer.

This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
E<lt>B<http://uazu.net/sbagen/>E<gt> to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
script looks like that:
	
	-SE
	a: 300-2.5/3 440+4.5/0
	b: 300-2.5/0 440+4.5/3
	off: -
	NOW      == a
	+0:07:00 == b
	+0:14:00 == a
	+0:21:00 == b
	+0:30:00    off


A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script uses
either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time) or only
relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
timestamps, then the I<NOW> reference for relative timestamps will be
taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and the
script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That means that if
the script is directly played, the actual times will match the absolute
timestamps up to the sound controller's clock accuracy, but if the user
somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all times will be shifted accordingly.


=head1 PROTOCOLS


Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access
resources which require the use of a particular protocol.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-protocols".

You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
"--disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
option "--enable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>", or you can disable a
particular protocol using the option
"--disable-protocol=I<PROTOCOL>".

The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported protocols.

A description of the currently available protocols follows.


=head2 bluray


Read BluRay playlist.

The accepted options are:

=over 4



=item B<angle>

BluRay angle


=item B<chapter>

Start chapter (1...N)


=item B<playlist>

Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)


=back


Examples:

Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:
	
	bluray:/mnt/bluray


Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start from chapter 2:
	
	-playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray



=head2 concat


Physical concatenation protocol.

Allow to read and seek from many resource in sequence as if they were
a unique resource.

A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:
	
	concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>


where I<URL1>, I<URL2>, ..., I<URLN> are the urls of the
resource to be concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct
protocol.

For example to read a sequence of files F<split1.mpeg>,
F<split2.mpeg>, F<split3.mpeg> with B<ffplay> use the
command:
	
	ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg


Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for
many shells.


=head2 file


File access protocol.

Allow to read from or read to a file.

For example to read from a file F<input.mpeg> with B<ffmpeg>
use the command:
	
	ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg


The ff* tools default to the file protocol, that is a resource
specified with the name "FILE.mpeg" is interpreted as the URL
"file:FILE.mpeg".


=head2 gopher


Gopher protocol.


=head2 hls


Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as
a uniform one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be
remote HTTP resources or local files, accessed using the standard
file protocol.
The nested protocol is declared by specifying
"+I<proto>" after the hls URI scheme name, where I<proto>
is either "file" or "http".

	
	hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
	hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8


Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work
just as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.
To use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the
m3u8 files.


=head2 http


HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).


=head2 mmst


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.


=head2 mmsh


MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

The required syntax is:
	
	mmsh://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>]



=head2 md5


MD5 output protocol.

Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can
be used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

Some examples follow.
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5
	
	# Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
	ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:


Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.


=head2 pipe


UNIX pipe access protocol.

Allow to read and write from UNIX pipes.

The accepted syntax is:
	
	pipe:[<number>]


I<number> is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the
pipe (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If I<number>
is not specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used
for writing, stdin for reading.

For example to read from stdin with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
	# ...this is the same as...
	cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:


For writing to stdout with B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
	# ...this is the same as...
	ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi


Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to
be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.


=head2 rtmp


Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for streaming multimedia
content across a TCP/IP network.

The required syntax is:
	
	rtmp://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<instance>][/<playpath>]


The accepted parameters are:

=item B<server>

The address of the RTMP server.


=item B<port>

The number of the TCP port to use (by default is 1935).


=item B<app>

It is the name of the application to access. It usually corresponds to
the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
(e.g. F</ondemand/>, F</flash/live/>, etc.). You can override
the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_app> option, too.


=item B<playpath>

It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to the
application specified in I<app>, may be prefixed by "mp4:". You
can override the value parsed from the URI through the C<rtmp_playpath>
option, too.

Each value is prefixed by a single character denoting the type,
B for Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null,
followed by a colon. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1 for
FALSE or TRUE, respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data must be 0 or
1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items in subobjects may
be named, by prefixing the type with 'N' and specifying the name before
the value (i.e. C<NB:myFlag:1>). This option may be used multiple
times to construct arbitrary AMF sequences.


=item B<rtmp_flashver>

Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default
is LNX 9,0,124,2.


=item B<rtmp_flush_interval>

is 10.


=item B<rtmp_live>

Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
live streams is possible. The default value is C<any>, which means the
subscriber first tries to play the live stream specified in the
playpath. If a live stream of that name is not found, it plays the
recorded stream. The other possible values are C<live> and
C<recorded>.


=item B<rtmp_pageurl>

URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
value will be sent.


=item B<rtmp_playpath>

"sample" from the application "vod" from an RTMP server "myserver":
	
	ffplay rtmp://myserver/vod/sample



=head2 rtmpe


Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

The Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMPE) is used for
streaming multimedia content within standard cryptographic primitives,
consisting of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and HMACSHA256, generating
a pair of RC4 keys.


=head2 rtmps


Real-Time Messaging Protocol over a secure SSL connection.

The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMPS) is used for streaming
multimedia content across an encrypted connection.


=head2 rtmpt

The Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTPS (RTMPTS) is used
for streaming multimedia content within HTTPS requests to traverse
firewalls.


=head2 rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte


Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through
librtmp.

Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
"--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
protocol.

This protocol provides most client functions and a few server
functions needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT),
encrypted RTMP (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled
variants of these encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

The required syntax is:
	
	<rtmp_proto>://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>] <options>


where I<rtmp_proto> is one of the strings "rtmp", "rtmpt", "rtmpe",
"rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each RTMP variant, and
I<server>, I<port>, I<app> and I<playpath> have the same
meaning as specified for the RTMP native protocol.
I<options> contains a list of space-separated options of the form
I<key>=I<val>.

See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream


To play the same stream using B<ffplay>:
	
	ffplay "rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1"



=head2 rtp


Real-Time Protocol.


=head2 rtsp


RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a demuxer
and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data transferred
over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and Real-RTSP (with
data transferred over RDT).

The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa Spiegelmock's
 RTSP server (C<http://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server>)).

The required syntax for a RTSP url is:
	
	rtsp://<hostname>[:<port>]/<path>


The following options (set on the B<ffmpeg>/B<ffplay> command
line, or set in code via C<AVOption>s or in C<avformat_open_input>),
are supported:

Flags for C<rtsp_transport>:


=over 4



=item B<udp>

Use UDP as lower transport protocol.


=item B<tcp>

Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
transport protocol.


=item B<udp_multicast>

Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.


=item B<http>

Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
passing proxies.

=back


Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they are
tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is tried).
For the muxer, only the C<tcp> and C<udp> options are supported.

Flags for C<rtsp_flags>:


=over 4


=item B<filter_src>

Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

=back


When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received packets
(since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost totally). This
can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to zero (via
the C<max_delay> field of AVFormatContext).

When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with B<ffplay>, the
streams to display can be chosen with C<-vst> I<n> and
C<-ast> I<n> for video and audio respectively, and can be switched
on the fly by pressing C<v> and C<a>.

Example command lines:

To watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:

	
	ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4


To watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:

	
	ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4


To send a stream in realtime to a RTSP server, for others to watch:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://server/live.sdp


To receive a stream in realtime:

	
	ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp <output>



=head2 sap


Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.
It is used for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the
streams regularly on a separate port.


=head3 Muxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:
	
	sap://<destination>[:<port>][?<options>]


The RTP packets are sent to I<destination> on port I<port>,
or to port 5004 if no port is specified.
I<options> is a C<&>-separated list. The following options
are supported:


=over 4



=item B<announce_addr=>I<address>

Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements to.
If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used SAP
announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net), or
ff0e::2:7ffe if I<destination> is an IPv6 address.


=item B<announce_port=>I<port>

Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to
9875 if not specified.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP packets,
defaults to 255.


=item B<same_port=>I<0|1>

If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero (the
default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each stream on a
port 2 numbers higher than the previous.
VLC/Live555 requires this to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.
The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving requires all streams to be sent
on unique ports.

=back


Example command lines follow.

To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1


Similarly, for watching in B<ffplay>:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255


And for watching in B<ffplay>, over IPv6:

	
	ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]



=head3 Demuxer


The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:
	
	sap://[<address>][:<port>]


I<address> is the multicast address to listen for announcements on,
if omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. I<port>
is the port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular stream.

Example command lines follow.

To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://


To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP multicast address:

	
	ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]



=head2 tcp


Trasmission Control Protocol.

The required syntax for a TCP url is:
	
	tcp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]



=over 4



=item B<listen>

Listen for an incoming connection


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval, raise error.
In write mode: if socket cannot be written in more than this time interval, raise error.
This also sets timeout on TCP connection establishing.

	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tcp://<hostname>:<port>?listen
	ffplay tcp://<hostname>:<port>



=back



=head2 tls


Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer

The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:
	
	tls://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]



=over 4



=item B<listen>

Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.


=item B<cafile=>I<filename>

Certificate authority file. The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.


=item B<cert=>I<filename>

Certificate file. The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.


=item B<key=>I<filename>

Private key file.


=item B<verify=>I<0|1>

Verify the peer's certificate.


=back


Example command lines:

To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tls://<hostname>:<port>?listen&cert=<server.crt>&key=<server.key>


To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using B<ffplay>:

	
	ffplay tls://<hostname>:<port>



=head2 udp


User Datagram Protocol.

The required syntax for a UDP url is:
	
	udp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]


I<options> contains a list of &-separated options of the form I<key>=I<val>.

In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
to store the incoming data, which allows to reduce loss of data due to
UDP socket buffer overruns. The I<fifo_size> and
I<overrun_nonfatal> options are related to this buffer.

The list of supported options follows.


=over 4



=item B<buffer_size=>I<size>

Set the UDP socket buffer size in bytes. This is used both for the
receiving and the sending buffer size.


=item B<localport=>I<port>

Override the local UDP port to bind with.


=item B<localaddr=>I<addr>

Choose the local IP address. This is useful e.g. if sending multicast
and the host has multiple interfaces, where the user can choose
which interface to send on by specifying the IP address of that interface.


=item B<pkt_size=>I<size>

Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.


=item B<reuse=>I<1|0>

Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.


=item B<ttl=>I<ttl>

Set the time to live value (for multicast only).


=item B<connect=>I<1|0>

Initialize the UDP socket with C<connect()>. In this case, the
destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url later.
If the destination address isn't known at the start, this option can
be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.
This allows finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
unreachable" is received.
For receiving, this gives the benefit of only receiving packets from
the specified peer address/port.


=item B<sources=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Only receive packets sent to the multicast group from one of the
specified sender IP addresses.


=item B<block=>I<address>B<[,>I<address>B<]>

Ignore packets sent to the multicast group from the specified
sender IP addresses.


=item B<fifo_size=>I<units>

Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number of
packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to 7*4096.


=item B<overrun_nonfatal=>I<1|0>

Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
value is 0.


=item B<timeout=>I<microseconds>

In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval, raise error.

=back


Some usage examples of the UDP protocol with B<ffmpeg> follow.

To stream over UDP to a remote endpoint:
	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> udp://<hostname>:<port>


To stream in mpegts format over UDP using 188 sized UDP packets, using a large input buffer:
	
	ffmpeg -i <input> -f mpegts udp://<hostname>:<port>?pkt_size=188&buffer_size=65535


To receive over UDP from a remote endpoint:
	
	ffmpeg -i udp://[<multicast-address>]:<port>



=head1 INPUT DEVICES


Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access
the data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices
are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
configure option "--list-indevs".

You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
"--disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input device using the
option "--enable-indev=I<INDEV>", or you can disable a particular
input device using the option "--disable-indev=I<INDEV>".

The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of
supported input devices (amongst the demuxers).

A description of the currently available input devices follows.


=head2 alsa


ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
installed on your system.

This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

An ALSA identifier has the syntax:
	
	hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]


where the I<DEV> and I<SUBDEV> components are optional.

The three arguments (in order: I<CARD>,I<DEV>,I<SUBDEV>)
specify card number or identifier, device number and subdevice number
(-1 means any).

To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
files F</proc/asound/cards> and F</proc/asound/devices>.

For example to capture with B<ffmpeg> from an ALSA device with
card id 0, you may run the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav


For more information see:
E<lt>B<http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html>E<gt>


=head2 bktr


BSD video input device.


=head2 dshow


Windows DirectShow input device.

DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64 project.
Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be
opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between them.

The input name should be in the format:

	
	<TYPE>=<NAME>[:<TYPE>=<NAME>]


where I<TYPE> can be either I<audio> or I<video>,
and I<NAME> is the device's name.


=head3 Options


If no options are specified, the device's defaults are used.
If the device does not support the requested options, it will
fail to open.


=over 4



=item B<video_size>

Set video device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
defaults to 0).


=item B<audio_device_number>

Set audio device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
defaults to 0).


=item B<pixel_format>

Select pixel format to be used by DirectShow. This may only be set when
the video codec is not set or set to rawvideo.


=item B<audio_buffer_size>

Set audio device buffer size in milliseconds (which can directly
impact latency, depending on the device).
Defaults to using the audio device's
default buffer size (typically some multiple of 500ms).
Setting this value too low can degrade performance.

The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction
layer to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the
console. It is accessed through a file device node, usually
F</dev/fb0>.

For more detailed information read the file
Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source tree.

To record from the framebuffer device F</dev/fb0> with
B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f fbdev -r 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi


You can take a single screenshot image with the command:
	
	ffmpeg -f fbdev -frames:v 1 -r 1 -i /dev/fb0 screenshot.jpeg


See also E<lt>B<http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/>E<gt>, and fbset(1).


=head2 iec61883


FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
C<--enable-libiec61883> to compile with the device enabled.

The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux
Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or "auto"
to choose the first port connected.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<dvtype>

Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto
detection does not work, or if usage of a different device type
should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV (or vice versa) will
not work and result in undefined behavior.
The values B<auto>, B<dv> and B<hdv> are supported.


=item B<dvbuffer>

Set maxiumum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV, this
is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV does
not have a fixed frame size.


=back

=back



=head2 jack


JACK input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
installed on your system.

A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
each audio channel, with name I<client_name>:input_I<N>, where
I<client_name> is the name provided by the application, and I<N>
is a number which identifies the channel.
Each writable client will send the acquired data to the FFmpeg input
device.

Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the B<jack_connect>
and B<jack_disconnect> programs, or do it through a graphical interface,
for example with B<qjackctl>.

To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the command
B<jack_lsp>.

Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
with B<ffmpeg>.
	
	# Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
	$ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav
	
	# Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
	$ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000
	
	# List the current JACK clients.
	$ jack_lsp -c
	system:capture_1
	system:capture_2
	system:playback_1
	system:playback_2
	ffmpeg:input_1
	metro:120_bpm
	
	# Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.
	$ jack_connect metro:120_bpm ffmpeg:input_1

=head2 lavfi


Libavfilter input virtual device.

This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
filtergraph.

For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
option B<graph>.


=head3 Options



=over 4



=item B<graph>

Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output must be
labelled by a unique string of the form "outI<N>", where I<N> is a
number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
generated by the device.
The first unlabelled output is automatically assigned to the "out0"
label, but all the others need to be specified explicitly.

If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
device.

=head2 libdc1394


IIDC1394 input device, based on libdc1394 and libraw1394.


=head2 openal


The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a
working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL
headers and libraries installed on your system, and need to configure
FFmpeg with C<--enable-openal>.

OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of your OpenAL
implementation, or as an additional download (an SDK). Depending on your
installation you may need to specify additional flags via the
C<--extra-cflags> and C<--extra-ldflags> for allowing the build
system to locate the OpenAL headers and libraries.

An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:


=over 4


=item B<Creative>

within the same B<ffmpeg> command:
	
	$ ffmpeg -f openal -i 'DR-BT101 via PulseAudio' out1.ogg -f openal -i 'ALSA Default' out2.ogg

Note: not all OpenAL implementations support multiple simultaneous capture -
try the latest OpenAL Soft if the above does not work.


=head2 oss


Open Sound System input device.

The filename to provide to the input device is the device node
representing the OSS input device, and is usually set to
F</dev/dsp>.

For example to grab from F</dev/dsp> using B<ffmpeg> use the

audio latency. By default it is unset.


=head2 sndio


sndio input device.

To enable this input device during configuration you need libsndio
installed on your system.

The filename to provide to the input device is the device node
representing the sndio input device, and is usually set to
F</dev/audio0>.

For example to grab from F</dev/audio0> using B<ffmpeg> use the
command:
	
	ffmpeg -f sndio -i /dev/audio0 /tmp/oss.wav



=head2 video4linux2


Video4Linux2 input video device.

The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device
(e.g. an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the
kind F</dev/videoI<N>>, where I<N> is a number associated to
the device.

Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of
I<width>xI<height> sizes and framerates. You can check which are
supported using B<-list_formats all> for Video4Linux2 devices.

Some usage examples of the video4linux2 devices with ffmpeg and ffplay:

The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the kernel
version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from the real time
clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock (origin usually at
boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to the clock). The
B<-timestamps abs> or B<-ts abs> option can be used to force
conversion into the real time clock.

Note that if FFmpeg is build with v4l-utils support ("--enable-libv4l2"
option), it will always be used.
	
	# Grab and show the input of a video4linux2 device.
	ffplay -f video4linux2 -framerate 30 -video_size hd720 /dev/video0
	
	# Grab and record the input of a video4linux2 device, leave the
	framerate and size as previously set.
	ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -input_format mjpeg -i /dev/video0 out.mpeg


"v4l" and "v4l2" can be used as aliases for the respective "video4linux" and
"video4linux2".


=head2 vfwcap


VfW (Video for Windows) capture input device.

The filename passed as input is the capture driver number, ranging from
0 to 9. You may use "list" as filename to print a list of drivers. Any
other filename will be interpreted as device number 0.


=head2 x11grab


X11 video input device.

This device allows to capture a region of an X11 display.

The filename passed as input has the syntax:
	
	[<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]


I<hostname>:I<display_number>.I<screen_number> specifies the
X11 display name of the screen to grab from. I<hostname> can be
omitted, and defaults to "localhost". The environment variable
B<DISPLAY> contains the default display name.

I<x_offset> and I<y_offset> specify the offsets of the grabbed
area with respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They
default to 0.

Check the X11 documentation (e.g. man X) for more detailed information.

Use the B<dpyinfo> program for getting basic information about the
properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for "name" or "dimensions").

For example to grab from F<:0.0> using B<ffmpeg>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


Grab at position C<10,20>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg



=head3 Options



=over 4


=item B<draw_mouse>

Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of C<0> specify
not to draw the pointer. Default value is C<1>.


=item B<follow_mouse>

Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be
C<centered> or a number of pixels I<PIXELS>.

When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows the mouse
pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region; otherwise, the region
follows only when the mouse pointer reaches within I<PIXELS> (greater than
zero) to the edge of region.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg


To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to edge:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<framerate>

Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is C<ntsc>,
corresponding to a framerate of C<30000/1001>.


=item B<show_region>

Show grabbed region on screen.

If I<show_region> is specified with C<1>, then the grabbing
region will be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to
know what is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

For example:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg


With I<follow_mouse>:
	
	ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg



=item B<video_size>

Set the video frame size. Default value is C<vga>.
