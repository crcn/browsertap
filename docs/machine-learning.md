What's the idea?

A virtual assistent that automatically runs through various test
cases with very little assistence. Basically just like rainforestQA without the humans. All praise the almighty robots!

#### Challenges

- computer vision. Automatically finding stuff like login buttons
- touch gestures & human motion
- UX-specific issues

#### How awesome?

- Timeless. Works with any device since it leverages computer vision.

#### Solutions

- automated assistent that helps with flows and suggestions
- gets smarter each time someone creates a flow
- come up with a flow automatically and let humans modify it.

#### Research

- checkout different apps and figure out common flows

#### How does this line up with BrowserTap?

- infastructure in place for launching any app. Just need a robo agent.
- could be its own product (probably should be)
