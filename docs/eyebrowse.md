Eyebrowse is an app that enables people to launch applications running on a different machine. Ideally The UI would not be limited to browsers, but also work for other things like mobile applications, and email clients.

#### Key features

- Quick launch menu would enable people to start apps quickly
- Some menu would show what VMs are currently running
- Machines can easily be connected through MDNS (bonjour)
- Automatically download IEVMS and run them

#### Why use this over browserstack / saucelabs?

- All offline
- Secure - run everything locally.
- Fast connection.
