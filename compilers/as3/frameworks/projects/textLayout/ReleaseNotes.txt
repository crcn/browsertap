	* Fix 2472372 Adornments are lost when lines scroll out of view.
	* Fix 2462178 [SDK-23782] TLF error messages shoud be localizable
	* Fix 2476491 Hitting a select all with more than one container, and then typing sometimes makes text go to the wrong container.
Build 546
	* Fix for 2469708, data binding issue with TLF SpanElement since 0-length spans are pruned from ParagraphElement. Solution is to not merge spans, links, or tcy elements that were added via set mxmlChildren, since they may have data binding applied. Note that zero-length elements left in the text may cause problems when editing; inserted text may appear in the wrong format, for example. This seems preferable to not supporting the feature. 
Build 545
	* Fix 2469183 paddingRight not applied in contentBounds in vertical measured text
	* Fix 2458351 [SDK-23668] TextFlow class marked as final
	* Fix 2464448 Rename package flash.textLayout.acc flash.textLayout.accessibility
	* Fix 2365702 [SDK-22011] Setting TextFlow attributes with out of range values should generate an RTE
	 -When an error is detected the format will no longer be changed.
	 -A number or int format setting will be in error if parseFloat (or parseInt) returns NaN.
	 - Out of range number or int properties will be an error
	 - Invalid enumeration settings will be an error
	 - Property class will have a global “errorCallback” function.  This will default to throwing on error. 
	 - The TLF ITextImporter implementers (for HTML and TLF markup) have a throwOnError setting.  If false the change will be to collect the errors in the errors array along with the other import errors as currently done.  If true then the importer will throw on the first error.  During an import the importers may temporarily replace the errorCallback function
	 - Clients may replace the global errorCallback function.
	 - Properties now treat null as undefined - this is to support flex data binding which sets properties to null with great frequency
	* Extended fix for 2365702 to HTML markup attributes that don't directly map to TLF formats. Also ensured malformed tags and text in HTML markup are not silently ignored.
Build 544
	* Fix underline offset for small point sizes.
Build 541
	* Fix 2448613 Perform truncation even if using explicit lineBreak, or measuring width
Build 540
	* Fix 2469885 Linked Containers Update Failures With Large Changes
Build 539
	* Fix 2468477 SelectionManager.menuSelectHandler should update menu.clipboardItems.delete based on the editingMode.
	* Fix Additional memory leak - the shared TextFlowTetLineFactory was holding on to references to the last flow composed
	* Fix 1874257 Typing always causes a redraw of the entire container
	- ContainerController no longer updates transparent background or scrollRect unless they have changed.
Build 538
	* Fix 2400856 Underline truncated on vertical orientation with default baseline shift.
	* Fix 2467390 composeToController always returns true and is not functioning
	* Fix 2448945 Changing character properties after entering text edit mode can produce mixed results unexpectedly in TLF Text containers.
Build 537
	* Fix 2464521 New paragraph always has default formatting when typing "Enter" at the start of a paragraph
	* Revised HTML importer/exporter to be more compatible with TextField.htmlText. It is more tolerant of malformed input, adds support for some new attributes (letterspacing, kerning, leading, tabstops etc.),
	  and relative font sizes, handles children of unknown elements (instead of completely stripping them out), preserves whitespace, accounts for the difference between TextField and TLF defaults 
	  (e.g., "Times Roman" vs. "Arial" fontFamily), and exports markup that is similar to that returned by TextField.htmlText.
Build 536
	* Fix 2350091 Tab stop positions shift when center and right aligning paragraphs.
	- in FlashPlayer 10.1 and later ONLY a TextLine with tabs on it will not be center or non-start aligned
	- this allows client to setup tabs with alignment as needed and for tabs in all lines to line up
Build 535
	* Fix 2457166 - Underline & strikethru adornments re-added to reused lines.  Adornments are now only added to damaged or new lines.
	* Fix 2363026 - Request to make dominant Baseline Auto value resolution for 270 Rotated text be Ideographic Center. 
	* Fix 2347988 - TCY canceled overriding image with TCY by text.
	* Fix 2384296 ContentBounds Incorrect for right/center aligned text in narrow containers with explicit lineBreaks
Build 534
	* Fix infinite loop deleting and pasting text in multiple containers.
	* Fix 2460189 ContentBounds Incorrect for left/start/center aligned text in containers of RL content with "toFit" lineBreaks
Build 533
	* Fix Modifying InlineGraphic with source set to a DisplayObject doesn't update
Build 532
	* Fix for 2445788 - getTextInRange did not properly return text when text spanned multiple paragraphs.  New code performs proper calculations and returns expected text.
Build 531
	* Fix for 2458403 - TLF default TextLayoutFormat fontFamily is now Arial rather than Times New Roman.
Build 530
	* Fixing bug in how link formats are exported, so colors will be exported in "#" format. 
Build 527
	* Additional fix for 2447819 - ComposeState was also holding onto references - now fixed
	* Performance improvement for flows with multiple containers.  StandardFlowComposer now quickly skips to the first damaged container during compose.
Build 525
	* Redefined IMEStatus constants from simple, raw, converted, etc, to compounds such as SELECTED_RAW, NOT_SELECTED_RAW, SELECTED_CONVERTED and NOT_SELECTED_CONVERTED.
Build 524
	* Fix 2446258 Cursor for first line of bottom aligned text container is incorrect.
	* Fix 2443549 Assertion error when placing graphic after another graphic in TCY.
	* Re-adjustment to Underline and Strikethrough code.  Positioning is more consistent than previous implementation.
	* Fix 2397598 Delete/Clear context menu commands don't work in Vellum containers.  New code properly supports action.
	* API CHANGE: Rename TextConverter HTML_FORMAT to TEXT_FIELD_HTML_FORMAT to better reflect the fact that this is based on the TextField htmlText property.
	* API CHANGE: Removed FXG_FORMAT from TextConverter. This was an old format, it is no longer supported. Use TEXT_LAYOUT_FORMAT instead.
Build 523
	* Integrated first pass implementation of Inline IME support.
Build 522
	* Fix 2441993 tcy improperly rotated in horizontal text.  Issue caused by failure of code to apply rotation of 0 under certain, unknown race conditions.  New code handles all cases and has unified rotation into single, private API.
	* Fix 2446323 paddingRight not taken into account when calculating the contentWidth of measured container
	* Fix for mis-alignment of underline and strikethrough on text.  Placement of UL and ST was inconsistent based on baseline alignment.  New code properly calculates UL/ST on runs of text.  Note that there are still inconsistencies between fonts due to reported values in FontMetrics which cannot be overcome.  However, relative placement within a single font face match regardless of baseline.
	* Fix case in links format where colors that came in as "0x" syntax were also exported via TLF markup as "0x". Now they are normalized to "#" syntax.
	* Fix 2437033 better worded exception when EditManager.deleteNextCharacter called on invalid text (e.g., when called from a FlowOperationEvent).
	* Fix 2434028 Tab key moving focus out of the editor after inserting tab.
	- API change added IInteractionEventHandler.keyFocusChangeHandler
	- TLF no longer sets tabEnabled flag to Containers passed to DisplayObjectController or TextContainerManager.  Client must manage that flag.
	- WinIE requires additional special handling in html wrapper.  See http://ats.macromedia.com/Players/ATS/ATS9AS2/Staging/html/browserHTML/SeamlessTabbing/SeamlessTabbingFalse7.htm
	* Fix 2447482 [SDK-23540] Make flashx.textLayout.container.ContainerController.attachTransparentBackgroundForHit()  public (made it tlf_internal)
	* Fix 2447819 ParcelList keeps reference to controller of last edited component preventing garbage collection
Build 521
	* Fix 2445581 FMR: [SDK-23517] RTE in ParagraphElement (and SpanElement) when setting null mxmlChildren
	* Fix 2432300 Geometry Left not included in contentBounds in vertical text
	* Fix (no bug #) FlowComposeBase.findLineAtPosition was ignoring preferPrevious parameter
	* MARKUP CHANGES: 
	     (1) linkNormalFormat, linkActiveFormat, and linkHoverFormat elements now expect to find the attributes on a child element called TextLayoutFormat. Here's an example of how it looks now: <a><linkActiveFormat><TextLayoutFormat textDecoration="underline"/></linkActiveFormat>Anchor</a>
	     (2) the named <format> element has been removed. You should apply the attributes directly to the element instead.
	* Fix SDK-22792 TLF SelectionManager.computeSelectionIndex runtime error
	* Updated the way color values are exported in TLF markup and FXG to use "#" format instead of "0x". 
Build 519
	* Fix 2431183 FlowElementMouseEvent variables should not be public
	* Fix 2431182 TextLayoutEvent needs a clone function.
	* Fix 2441765 Calling updateToController on uncomposed content generates an error
	* Fix 2420904 Autoscrolling with explicit lineBreaks
	* Fix 2428141 Insertion point should not show when text is scrolled so insertion pt no longer visible (lineBreak=explicit)
Build 518
	* Implementation of code needed to support inline IME (though not the actual implementation of inline IME), searchability and certain missing API's needed to support
	  future accessibility functionality.
	* Fix 2437575 Argument Error in TextBlock.releaseLines when changing NumContainers
	* Fix 2394529 When paddingLeft and paddingRight are set, at the container controller sometimes returns different content widths.
Build 517
	* Fix 2414442 ElementFormat.getFontMetrics needs to be called in proper context
	  replace ITextLineCreator with ISWFContext.  ISWFContext has one method callInContext similar to flex method of the same name
	  replace textLineCreator setters with swfContext setters in IFlowComposer and TextContainerManager
	  Note: ITextLineCreator remains so that TLF test apps compile.  It's completely unused.
Build 516
	* Add new manifest entry for TextLayoutFormat, and remove entries for format, linkNormalFormat, linkActiveFormat, linkHoverFormat, EditManager, SelectionManager, and StandardFlowComposer. 
	  Updated build scripts so the manifest for textLayout_edit is removed. Removed the stub objects for linkActiveFormat, linkNormalFormat and linkHoverFormat, 
	  these are now handled as standard properties in MXMLC. Dynamic import of markup unchanged. Fixed use of ${forkValue} to be consistent in Ant build scripts.
	* Fix 2391771, data from one import is carried over into the following import. The bug happens because of how we are handling the id property. 
	  Problem is that clearing the array does not remove the dynamic properties of the array. Updating the code so that it allocates a bindingArray only if it is used, 
	  instead of allocating once at construction, and clear() now nulls out the previous bindingArray. 
	* Fix 2425075 MAX: When you have multiple containers that a flow goes through, the text will sometimes disappear.
Build 511
	* Fix 2429543: Text doesn't recompose with a change to dominantBaseline... - Issue caused by use of auto value in cached element formats. New code properly resolves auto values for dominantBaseline.
	* Fix 2375158 MAX: Character attributes revert to their default settings when you delete all text.
	* Fix 2424847 MAX: Certain formatting operations in linked flows can result in FlowElement.deleteContainerText getting caught in an infinite loop.
	* Fix 2393374 MAX: If you delete a newline at the end of a text flow and then Undo, TLF has an error.
Build 510
	* Fix 2417461 MAX: Text selection is difficult and flickers in TCM if there is scrolling text
Build 509
	* Fix 2425242 ContentWidth is reported incorrectly for linked containers.
Build 507
	* Fix 2412931 Doc bug - fontSize (and other TextLayoutFormat properties) do not specify the type (number, int, unit etc.)
	* Partial fix 2355904 Scrolling Performance (its improved but there's still a larger piece of work to fully resolve this issue)
	* Fix 2414731 - Reopened with request to make ContainerController attachAllContainers and detachAllContainers tlf_internal

Build 502
	* Fix 2376037 Empty spans with formatting are lost on import
	* Fix 2402561 Change to IFlowComposer.composeToPosition
	- composeToPosition - previously 0 meant compose to the end.  Now <= 0 means not specified.  Any value >= textFlow.textLength means compose to the end.  Default value changed to int.MAX_VALUE
	- updateToController and composeToController are also updated.  <= 0 means not specified.  Any value >= numControllers means compose to the end.  Default value changed to int.MAX_VALUE
Build 501
	* Fix 2395427 HTML importer is adding paragraph breaks for every <B>, <I>, <U>, and <FONT> tag that is not nested in a <P> tag. Implied paragraphs should be shared to the extent possible.
	* Fix 1905291 Workaround for redundant text input events fired after ctrl(cmd)+z and ctrl(cmd)+y
	* Fix 2375077 Container alignment isn't applied correctly to linked containers.
	* Fix 2399806 FMR: TextContainerManager bug and enhancements
	    - TCM.invalidateUndoManager() does not recreate the edit manager if interactionManager.editingMode == EditingMode.READ_WRITE.
	    - EditManager.keyUpHandler should check isDefaultPrevented() and return immediately if true.
	    - Make convertToTextFlowWithComposer() have tlf_internal access?
	* Fix 2380818 Factory/TextFlow Line Placement Mismatch With Vertical Text and Measured Height

Build 439
	* API and markup Changes (Fix 2339174) 
	-- marginTop, marginBottom, marginLeft and marginRight formats have been renamed to paragraphSpaceBefore, paragraphSpaceAfter, paragraphStartIndent and paragraphEndIndent respectively
	-- paragraphStartIndent and paragraphEndIndent are direction-sensitive. For example, the former applies to the paragraph's left edge for left-to-right text, and to the right edge otherwise
	-- These formats now inherit values from parent flow element if undefined during cascade
	-- The previous names continue to be supported on import of FXG markup (but not TLF markup). FXG export uses the new names.

Build 426
	* Fix bug 2329480 - TextFlow double-deletes text when pressing the backspace or delete key
Build 422
   	* API Changes: TextContainerManager now has a getContentBounds function, in place of individual getters for contentLeft, contentTop, etc. ContainerController also now has a getContentBounds function, in place of individual getters. Added functions to TextContainerManager to support custom classes for ISelectionManager and IEditManager (see createSelectionManager and createEditManager).
   	* API changes for TextContainerManager:
	   - getInteractionManager renamed to beginInteraction(), and added a new function endInteraction() which clients should use after beginInteraction() to signal that they are done with selecting/editing. This tells the TextContainerManager that it can go back to factory mode, which is more efficient.
	   - invalidateInteractionManager() removed and replaced with two new functions, invalidateSelectionFormats() which clients should called when SelectionFormats have changed, and invalidateUndoManager which clients should call to change the undo manager.
   	* API Changes for InputManager
	   InputManager renamed as TextContainerManager
	   IInputManagerClient removed, now you can subclass InputManager and override its methods
   	* API Changes:
	   InputManager
	       damaged property renamed to isDamaged() function
	       focusSelectionFormat renamed to focusedSelectionFormat
	       container retyped to Sprite
	       compositionWidth and compositionHeight removed as constructor parameters, now you need to set the properties on the InputManager you create
	    ContainerController
	       container retyped to Sprite
	    ISelectionManager
	       focusSelectionFormat renamed to focusedSelectionFormat
	    IConfiguration & Configuration
	       focusSelectionFormat renamed to focusedSelectionFormat
	* API Changes: 
		ISelectionManager
			setSelection deselects if negative numbers are passed in. 
			selectAll removed, you can call ISelection.setSelection() to get the same behavior, if you need to redraw the selection, call ISelectionManager.textFlow.flowComposer.updateAllControllers(). 
			flushPendingEvents moved to IInteractionHandler
			notifyInsertOrDelete moved to IInteractionHandler
		IUndoManager
			clear renamed to clearAll(). 
			undoLastOperation renamed to undo()
			redoLastOperation renamed to redo()
	* API Change: SelectionEvent now contains a SelectionState, not an ElementRange; this is much cheaper for us to provide. ElementRange is now tlf_internal. ElementRange.firstLeafPosition renamed to absoluteStart, ElementRange.lastLeafPosition renamed to absoluteEnd.
	* API Change: TextScrap.copyTextScrap renamed to clone. 
	* API Changes to InputManager. defaultInputManagerConfiguration renamed to defaultConfiguration. composeToController renamed to compose(), and updateToController renamed to updateContainer().
	* API Changes:
		ISelectionManager:
		- Event handling functions moved out of ISelectionManager into new interface, IInteractionHandler
		- selectionFormat renamed to currentSelectionFormat
		- selectionState renamed to function getSelectionState()
		- setSelection now takes default parameters to select the entire flow
		- noFocusSelectionFormat renamed to unfocusedSelectionFormat
		SelectionFormat:
		- blockAlpha reanmed to rangeAlpha
		- blockBlendMode renamed to rangeBlendMode
		- blockColor renamed to rangeColor
		IEditManager
		- added get undoManager()
		- added changeElementID()
		- added changeElementStyleName()
		SelectionManager
		- activeMark and anchorMark are now private
		- selectionChanged is private
		- setSelectionState is tlf_internal
		EditManager
		- stage is private
		ChangeElementIdOperation renamed to ChangeElementIDOperation
Build 420
	* API change: Removed the misleadingly named and superfluous TextFlowLine.textIndent. Documented and ensured consistent use of TextFlowLine.lineOffset as lhe line's offset in pixels from the appropriate container inset (as dictated by paragraph direction and container block progression), prior to alignment of lines in the paragraph.  
	* API change: more changes to the factory classes. ITextLineCreator is now a property of the base class, so instead of passing it in the constructor you construct and then set the property in the factory. bounds property renamed to compositionBounds, and measuredBounds renamed to contentBounds. containerController property is now private.
	* API Change: moved ITextLineCreator interface from the elements package to the compose package.
	* PlainTextExporter is now public and has methods for controlling the paragraphSeparator and whether discretionary hyphens are included in the export. To use it, you can either construct it directly, or via the TextFilter class. Removed the newlineIndicator string from IConfiguration.
	* Fixed a bug where tabs in RTL text were being being offset by textIndent and marginRight values. 
Build 419
	* Once a mouseWheel event has been handled, mark with preventDefault so client applications don't also try to handle it. 
	* Don't start compose if text is already composed. Optimization for callers of composeToPosition.
	* Always call resetContentTopLeft, to give more accurate top left positions, particularly for cases where the text is outdented and left aligned. 
	* API CHANGE: TextLineFactory revised. It is now split into 3 classes, TextLineFactoryBase, StringTextLineFactory, and TextFlowTextLineFactory. Use StringTextLineFactory for creating TextLines from a String. Use TextFlowTextLineFactory for creating TextLines from a TextFlow. Static methods have been removed, so create a new factory in order to create lines. One factory may be reused many times, just resetting the values (text, bounds, truncation options, etc.) in between. See StaticHelloWorld.as for a simple example of how this works for Strings, see StaticTextFlow.as for a simple example of it with TextFlows.
Build 418
	* Fixed Vertical Justification behavior; it now increases the spacing between consecutive lines proportionally rather than spacing lines uniformly.
Build 417
	* API Changes: Renamed DisplayObjectContainerController to ContainerController, and removed IContainerController and IInternalContainerController. Wherever you used to use "IContainerController" or "DisplayObjectContainerController" now just use "ContainerController". 
			Moved some functions that were public into the tlf_internal namespace: effectivePaddingLeft, effectivePaddingTop, effectivePaddingRight, and effectivePaddingBottom.
			ColumnState.createColumnState removed. A ColumnState constructor now takes all the relevant values, so whereever you used to do this:
				var columnState:ColumnState = ColumnState.createColumnState(...your values here...);
			you can now do this:
				var columnState:ColumnState = new ColumnState();
			ColumnState.getColumnAtIndex(index) has been renamed to getColumnAt(index). So, once you have the columnState, you do, for instance:
				var columnRect:Rectangle = getColumnAt(0);
	* Fixed bug where spaces at end of a line would "overflow" into neighboring columns.  New code keeps drawing of cursor at the column boundary and limits block selection drawing to the same bounds.
	* Enhancement to cursor navigation for Right to Left text systems.  Previous code moved cursor according to logical order vs. visual order.  Result was that a right arrow key press in Arabic, Hebrew or other RTL languages meant that the cursor actually moved left.  New code moves cursor according to the visual order of the text based on the direction of the entire text flow.  Note that changing the direction on a paragraph will not alter the behavior of the cursor, nor will the presence of LTR text within a RTL text flow.  This means that if a TextFlow is set to Right to Left and a given paragraph is entirely in English and the paragraph is set to be Left to Right, the cursor will seem to move in the wrong direction.  TLF does not support customization of cursor movement based on the locale or direction of anything except the parent TextFlow.
  	* Fixed a bug that caused undoing an ApplyFormatToElementOperation to have no effect.
Build 416
Build 415
Build 414
	* API Changes:
			DisplayObjectContainer event handling functions renamed:
				processMouseOverEvent -> mouseOverHandler
				processMouseOutEvent -> mouseOutHandler
				processMouseWheelEvent -> mouseWheelHandler
				processMouseDownEvent -> mouseDownHandler
				processMouseUpEvent -> mouseUpHandler
				processMouseMoveEvent -> mouseMoveHandler
				processMouseDoubleClickEvent -> mouseDoubleClickHandler
				processFocusInEvent -> focusInHandler
				processFocusOutEvent -> focusOutHandler
				processActivateEvent -> activateHandler
				processDeactivateEvent -> deactivateHandler
				processKeyDownEvent -> keyDownHandler
				processKeyUpEvent -> keyUpHandler
				processTextInputEvent -> textInputHandler
				processContextMenuSelectHandler -> menuSelectHandler
				eventHandler -> editHandler
			ISelectManager & SelectionManager & EditManager renamings:
				eventHandler -> editHandler
Build 413
  	* API Changes: renamed IContainerController.scrollLines to getScrollDelta, renamed InputManager.scrollLines to getScrollDelta, and removed constants for default container width and height.
Build 412
  	* API CHANGE: DisplayObjectContainerController methods processCopyEvent, processCutEvent, processPasteEvent, processSelectAllEvent collapsed into a single processEvent that handles all these basic events. Added to ISelectionManager a new function, processEvent for handling these same events in the SelectionManager, and removed processSelectAll, which is no longer used. cutTextScrap and pasteTextScrap moved from ISelectionManager to IEditManager, since these are editing operations.
Build 411
  	* Fixed a bug where noFocus selection format was not being set on re-activation
	* API CHANGES. These functions in IFlowComposer were renamed:
  		updateContainer -> updateToController
  		updateAllContainers -> updateControllers
  		composeContainer -> composeToController
  		composePosition -> composeToPosition
  	* API CHANGE: Changing name of TextFlow.hostTextLayoutFormat to hostFormat.
  	* API CHANGE: Added ITextLineCreator interface, TextLineCreator concrete class, and textLineCreator property on IFlowComposer, TLFTextField, factory methods, and InputManager.
Build 410
	* Fix bug where leading info used for composing the next line was being saved prematurely, causing incorrect layout if the current line needed to be composed in multiple passes.
Build 409
	* Fix bug  where clicking on container when height or width NaN doesn't work. When measuring, transparent hit detect region wasn't being redrawn to correct size after composition.
	* API CHANGE: Plain-text import/export changes. Newline indicators exported based on setting in IConfiguration.newLineIndicator. On import, LF/CR/CR+LF are all recognized as new line indicators.
Build 408
	* Compose to container size with scrolling on -- previously was composing to double composer size. This may flush out some invalid line bugs.
	* Fixed a bug with blockProgression="rl" and compositionWidth=NaN, lines were getting improperly clipped out so that no text appeared. 
	* API CHANGE: Renaming functions in IFormatResolver. invalidateAllTargets is now invalidateAll, and invalidateTarget is now invalidate. resolveTextLayoutFormat is now resolveFormat.
	* API CHANGE: eventMirror on FlowLeafElement and SubParagraphGroupElement is now tlf_internal.
	* API CHANGE: Moving TextRange from the edit package to the elements package.
Build 406 (2009/04/02)
	* API CHANGE: Renaming DamageEvent.damageStart to damageAbsoluteStart.
	* API Change: IConfiguration.includePartialLine renamed to overflowPolicy. Defined new class OverflowPolicy that describes the different policies that can be used to control whether lines that fall at the end of the container are included in the container, or not.
Build 405 (2009/04/01)
	* API CHANGE: IFlowComposer.firstDamagePosition renamed to damageStartPosition.
	* API CHANGE: Rename GeometryUtil.getRangeBounds to GeometryUtil.getHighlightBounds.
	* API CHANGE: ParagraphElement.getText now takes an additional optional parameter that specifies the terminator for the paragraph. By default, this is the Unicode paragraph terminator character (\u2029), but you can make it whatever you want, including a simple newline by passing a String for the paragraphTerminator. This change is backwards compatible for current callers of getText().
	* Fix clipping problem when text is placed above the container (6 lines aligned verticalAlign = bottom in a space that fits 4 lines). 
Build 404 (2009/03/31)
	* Updating typgraphic case --Markup and API Change-- Now uses a new class TLFTypographicCase, and has different options. Support for "title" and "caps" dropped. Use TLFTypographicCase with TLF in preference to flash.text.engine.TypographicCase. "smallCaps" renamed to "capsToSmallCaps". "capsAndSmallCaps" renamed to "lowercaseToSmallCaps". Also made AUTO the default setting for kerning, which matches FXG spec.
Build 403 (2009/03/30)
	* format Markup Changes:
		- <TextLayoutFormat> now <format>
		- When referring to a format id, don't use brackets. So this:
			<TextLayoutFormat id="english" locale="en" fontFamily="Minion Pro"/>
			<p marginBottom="15" ><span format="{english}">This text is supposed to be in Minion Pro via a named character attribute</span></p>
		Is now this:
			<format id="english" locale="en" fontFamily="Minion Pro"/>
			<p marginBottom="15" ><span format="english">This text is supposed to be in Minion Pro via a named character attribute</span></p>	
		
		API Changes:
		- Rename FlowElement.textLayoutFormat -> format
		- Rename FlowElement.computedTextLayoutFormat -> computedFormat
		- Rename IContainerController.textLayoutFormat -> format
		- Rename IContainerController.textLayoutFormat -> computedFormat
		- Rename DisplayObjectContainerController.textLayoutFormat -> format
		- Rename DisplayObjectContainerController.textLayoutFormat -> computedFormat	
Build 402 (2009/03/27)
	*	verticalAlign of "middle" or "bottom" will now align to the compositionHeight (or compositionWidth in vertical text) even if the height of the text exceeds the compositionHeight. This means that lines that don't fit may be get pushed above the box, or (for middle) pushed both above and below. It also means that all lines will forced to compose to the end, so it will be quite slow to use verticalAlign in large text flows. Made some corresponding fixes to scrolling to make it work with text off the start of the container. Added some new test cases to exercise this functionality in all the different alignment settings.
	*	Scrolling fixes for next/previous line with arrow keys. Fix a bug where the arrow key would move to the end of the line if the line required composition (e.g., the line was not previously in view). Also fixed a bug when scrolling up by a line where it would scroll down instead.
	*	doOperation used to return an SelectionState, but with the exception of two places that were using it internally, all external callers only checked to see if it was null or not. null was being used to indicate failure, or nothing changed, which means that the operation is not placed on the undo stack. Now it returns a Boolean, true for success, false for failure. There may be further changes in this area to make FlowOperations simpler.
Build 397 (2009/03/20)
	*	Made DisplayObjectContainerController's and FlowElement's TextLayoutFormat properties read/write (used to be write-only).
	*	Merge ContainerControllerBase class into DisplayObjectContainerController.
	*	Mark TextFlow class as final
Build 396 (2009/03/19)
	*	Fix RTE in StandardFlowComposer.releaseLines
	*	Fix possible source of the RTE on null reference from findFirstAndLastVisibleLines in ContainerControllerBase.
Build 394 (2009/03/17)
	*	Fix issue with changes made in StatusChangeEvent to embedded graphics by blocking recursive composition.  Bug 2298043
	*	Add IFlowComposer.composeInProcess property. s
	*	Fixed problem where first part of a link could not be replaced by a new link.  New code allows partial replacement of a link element with a selection which starts at the first character.
	*	Fixed a problem where the cursor was getting set to the I-beam, and wouldn't set back.
Build 393 (2009/03/16)
	*	Fix a bug where keyboard navigation with linked containers was causing a scroll because it was trying to scroll to a position not in the container.
Build 392 (2009/03/13)
	*	Removed optimization that was preventing scrolling in the logical width direction if scrolling in the logical vertical direction was turned off.
	*	Removed the container-level mouseMove and rollOver handlers which were changing the link state. These are now part of the LinkElement, and added only when they are needed. 
Build 390 (2009/03/11)
	*	Fix for application of attributes to a point selection where only the last attribute would be applied.  New code applies all attributes applied to the point.
	*	IContainerController.contentWidth (or contentHeight in vertical text) is now based on the actual text width, not the unjustified text width. This fixes some problems where scrolling wasn't working correctly because the reported width of the text was greater than the compositionWidth, but lines were wrapped. It does mean that to get the unjustified width you will have to set the textAlign to something other than "justify", recompose, and then get the resulting width.
	*	Fix for unintended scroll when at the end of a TextFlow.
	*	Fix for RTE when dragging over text generated from a factory, or non-TLF TextLines.
	*	Changes for alignment and measurement. You can now set NaN for compositionWidth or compositionHeight, and TLF will compose and use the generated contentWidth or contentHeight for alignment, scrolling, etc. The composer now generates a topLeft for the bounds, so you can make a full "content bounds" using contentLeft, contentTop, contentWidth, and contentHeight.Note that this is logical bounds and not inked bounds, so there are some circumstances where ink will not fit in the content bounds.Fixed bugs in how the factory was doing vertical alignment that caused it to be a few pixels off.Fixed some incosistencies between how the standard flow composer worked and how the factory's simple composer works -- composition results should now be more uniform. Added a new test program, MeasurementGrid, for testing all this. It's still a work in progress.
Build 388 (2009/03/09)
	*	Fixed issue where applying link or TCY to the last span of a paragraph caused a dangling span to remain with the para terminator.
	*	Fixed issue where text would go into a link when it was the last element in a paragraph.  Newly typed text now goes into a new span when the selection marker is at the last index.
Build 386 (2009/03/06)
	*	Fixed issue with placement of underline and strikethrough on inline images.
	*	Fixed placement of underline and strikethrough on text which has a baseline shift applied to it.
Build 385 (2009/03/04)
	*	Combined SWC 'textLayout.swc' now included in the libs directory of the build. This includes everything from textLayout_core, textLayout_edit, and textLayout_conversion.
	*	Combined RSLs now included in the rsl directory of the build. Both an unsigned SWF and signed SWZ are created. These include everything from textLayout_core, textLayout_edit, and textLayout_conversion.
Build 382 (2009/03/02)
	*	Fix issue with composing a TextFlow containing just an empty ParagraphElement.
	*	TextLineFactory will generate lines that included InlineGraphics whose source is a "class" - normally an embedded graphic.
	*	Expose eventMirrors - use FlowElement.getEventMirror function to access the eventMirror.
Build 381 (2009/02/27)
	*	Fixed issue with graphic assigned to ILG getting the wrong sizing.
	*	Factory instance functions renamed to textLinesFromString and textLinesFromTextFlow.  Static functions renamin unchanged.
Build 380 (2009/02/26)
	*	Made backgroundColor work with TextLineFactory.  This required an API change - the callback to the factory now must take a DisplayObject as	its parameter, since it won't always be passed TextLines.  Also, the background shapes themselves no longer include leading, so they do not exactly coincide with the selection bounds.  This was another change to support calculating the shapes during composition as opposed to afterward. Also added a snapshot test as part of FactoryImportTest that uses backgroundColor, in addition to updating the existing unit tests.
Build 379 (2009/02/25)
	*	Fixed for multiple containers ( we were getting incorrect textLength in the containers), as well as a fix that forces scrollToPosition to compose if the text isn't composed yet.
	*	Fix so that we scroll to the active position of the selection after we extend the selection with a keyboard event. Also fixed some of the TextRangeUtil functions used for nextLine, etc. to make sure text is composed through selection before processing that depends on composition results.
	*	Plain text import now consistently converts \r to space; previously it was converting only the first one. Still not clear what correct behavior should be.
Build 377 (2009/02/23)
	*	Fix bug with importing trailing empty div elements.
Build 374 (2009/02/18)
	*	Added support for TextField-style leading. A new leading model value allows lineHeight to be interpreted as the distance of line's ascent from the previous line's descent. Further, lineHeight can be negative. which specifies the criteria for truncation, the string used to indicate truncation and the format for this string.
Build 372 (2009/02/16)
	*	Added "enableAccessibility" property to IConfiguration, defaults to false.  Allows clients to avoid paying price for TextAccImpl objects unless needed.
	*	Added support for truncation for text composed using TextLineFactory. The TextLineFactory methods now take a truncation options parameter, which specifies the criteria for truncation, the string used to indicate truncation and the format for this string.
Build 371 (2009/02/13)
	*	Fixed a number of bugs relating to scrolling by line.
	*	Measurement changes. Changed the way contentHeight and contentWidth are calculated, now they reflect the size of the text, regardless of alignment. Eliminated unjustifiedContentHeight and unjustifiedContentWidth; use contentHeight and contentWidth instead.
	*	Fix RTE in damage when we try to damage back one line, for textFlow that doesn't have any leaf nodes.
	*	Changed InlineGraphicElement so that GraphicElements (and the TextBlocks they are part of) don't get released. Fixes RTE on null pointer in places where we access the GraphicElement.
	*	Fix bug deleting all of the last Span of a paragraph, plus some of the following paragraph. 
Build 370 (2009/02/12)
	*	Removed textFlow property from CompositionCompletionEvent.  Use event.target to get to the TextFlow.
Build 369 (2009/02/11)
	*	Fix issues in usage of hostTextLayoutFormat
	*	Fix FXG export to not export styles with value "inherit"
	*	lineBreak property no longer inherits by default
Build 368 (2009/02/10)
	*	Fix for RTE that happens after cancelling an operation (calling preventDefault on a FlowOperationEvent).
Build 367 (2009/02/09)
	*	ported to Flex 4.0.0.4836. All SWCs now build with this SDK.
Build 366 (2009/02/06)
﻿	*	FlowGroupElement addChild, addChildAt and replaceChildren methods now automatically delete new elements from any existing parents.  Previously the code would test for parent on new elements and throw.
	*	mxmlChildren FlowElement property which is normally used for mxml compilation of TextFlow objects now always deletes existing children
	*	Fix a memory leak issue with the TextLayoutFormat cache
	*	Fix cascade bug with non-inheriting attributes getting inherited
Build 365 (2009/02/05)
	*	Changed TextLayoutFormat.backgroundColor to allow setting value of "transparent" (now the default).  Because of this new value for backgroundColor, backgroundAlpha now defaults to 1.
Build 364 (2009/02/04)
	*	Performance improvement for handling of TextFlow.hostTextLayoutFormat.  The code now assumes that once set by the client the supplied object won't be changed.  This avoids a copy.
Build 363 (2009/02/03)
	*	Performance work.  Remove getCanonical from TextLayoutFormat.
	*	Fix for RTE cancelling SplitParagraphOperation.
	*	Fixing some float bugs.
