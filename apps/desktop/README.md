#### TODOS

- [ ] setup authentication - should be under SSL - maybe just use webrtc for this
- [ ] look into using websockets for basic signaling - no authentication is SSL key is required
- [ ] possibly add a "sync" layer which watches a resource and moves it into the active record DB
- [ ] add tests using google test suites
- [ ] change core::EventEmitter to events::EventEmitter
