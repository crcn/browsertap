  // <TechnicalDetails>
  //
  // EXPECT_EQ(expected, actual) is the same as
  //
  //   EXPECT_TRUE((expected) == (actual))
  //
  // except that it will print both the expected value and the actual
  // value when the assertion fails.  This is very helpful for
  // debugging.  Therefore in this case EXPECT_EQ is preferred.
  //
  // On the other hand, EXPECT_TRUE accepts any Boolean expression,
  // and is thus more general.
