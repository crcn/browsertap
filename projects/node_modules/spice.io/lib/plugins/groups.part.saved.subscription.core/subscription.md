The subscription bean allows for any bean to listen for updates when a user curates articles, links, videos, or notes into a group. This could be a newsletter bean which sends off emails to users - see [theurld](http://theurld.com). This could also be used to time posts out to any social network such as twitter, facebook, linked-in, etc.
