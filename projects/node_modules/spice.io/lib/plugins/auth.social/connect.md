The connect bean is a nice wrapper that provides the ability to connect a users account with your application. You can easily add your own bean that hooks into this, or you can add the facebook, twitter, or google beans.

Once the user has connected their account, a new profile is created *for* the user. You can easily connect multiple accounts under the same profile simply by providing the same access token the user is logged in with. **There is a slight caveat** - accounts can be used under **one** profile. If you try and link an account with multiple access tokens, the account will move from one profile to another.


Here are some examples:
