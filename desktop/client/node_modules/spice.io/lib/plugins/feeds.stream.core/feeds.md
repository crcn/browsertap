Feeds are pretty self explainatory. You can easily pull data from any number of feeds such a youtube search, twitter search, RSS feed, etc.  Feeds are cached, but the backend loads new data depending on how quickly the feeds are updated. The minimum refresh time is 10 seconds. 

### Streamed Feeds

Unfiltered, un-augmented data from any available source. Note that streamed feeds are cached, then dumped from the database once it exceeds a certain buffer amount. Right now it's set to 30 items per feed, but it can be easily be changed. This limit is set to prevent the database from getting too big.

### New Feeds

Augmented data, meaning articles are parsed for content, and media (videos, images, etc.). Anything without media is ignored. "New" Feeds are stored forever. 

### Hot Feeds

Same as new, except data is sorted based on popularity around the web, and time.

### Top Feeds

Same as hot, except data is sorted based on popularity / day.
