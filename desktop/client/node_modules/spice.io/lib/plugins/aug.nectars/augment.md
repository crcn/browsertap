The augment bean takes input data, and makes it look nicer. It's completely extendable. Any bean can register a pattern to look for. For example, the readability bean looks for articles, and pulls out the text and media. Another example might be a bean which takes the same article from recipe websites and parses out the ingredients list!

Here's a list of augmentable items to far:

- short url to long url expanding
- youtube video search
- parsing out media based on service. E.g: youtube link provided in twitter post expanded to youtube video in spice.io.

Here's a working example:
