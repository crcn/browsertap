This is just some pseudocode. It doesn't actually work.

## Walkthrough

First call `npm install` in the root directory. It does a few things:

1. Installs any dependencies in `package.json`
2. calls `scripts/mesh-install.js node`

Since `npm install` is called, it's assumed the library is for a *node* program, hence the appended `node` flag on the script.

`scripts/mesh-install.js` would be a some boilerplate code generated by mesh for easy installation for cases such as this.
